A tool to find open ports, scans upto 10000 ports by default, could be changed by editing the main.rs 

## USAGE

```
$ cargo run -- -j <number of threads> <ip address> 
```


## Plans for future versions

1) make the tool scan  a list of ip addresses simultaneously, (can be done with xargs currently)
2) add GUI option by hosting a webpage on localhost
3) automatically resolve URL's into IP Addresses
